Experimenting with GDAL C++ api and basemap rendering

Datasets from National Land Survey of Finland (+ Digiroad, same geometries than Topographic Database but with more metadata) and Corine.


Live demo at: https://napuu.xyz/mapboxfront/

Keep in mind that

a) tiles are really not optimized at all right now, only viable as rendered

b) stylesheet is very simple and missing lots of details. just trying out maputnik
