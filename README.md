# mapthingy
Experimenting with GDAL C++ api and basemap rendering

Datasets from National Land Survey of Finland (+ Digiroad, same geometries than Topographic Database but with more metadata) and Corine.

Keep in mind that<br>
a) tiles are huge right now, rasters should be rendered at the backend / make vector tiles smaller<br>
b) stylesheet is very simple and missing lots of details. just trying out maputnik
